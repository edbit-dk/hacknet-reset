- This is a complete list of the most common usernames and passwords I have found different terminals use on the ARPANET. 
- Some give (backdoor) ADMIN access, some don't. 
- Try at your own risk (remember to delete logs, if you don't want to get hacked/traced)!

USERNAME:PASSWORD

admin:admin - (DEFAULT SUPERUSER)
admin:000001 - (DEFAULT USER)
guest: - (GUEST ACCOUNT)

admin:password - (BBS servers)
help:games - (GAME SERVERS)
admin:alpine - (MAIL SERVERS)
ftp:uploader - (FTP SERVERS)
admin:00000000 - (ARMY SERVERS)

HINTS:
1) If a system has -extra- security in place (like a firewall or proxy), you probaly cannot brute-force into the system using these usernames and password. Instead, you have to use our custom programs and tools on the FTP server!
2) Sometimes people use passwords with close relation to their family and loved ones to make the password more unique. Try looking up their names in different databases, to find more info about them.
