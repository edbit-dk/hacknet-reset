[START ENTRY - 1984-04-04]
I understand now that everything is a lie.  
Even the past is not safe. The Party can erase it, and they do.  
Sometimes I think I'm the only one who remembers.

—I think I remember the real numbers. I think I remember Eastasia being our ally.  
—I shouldn't be writing this.  
—Thoughtcrime is death. Thoughtcrime does not entail death: **thoughtcrime IS death.**

No one is watching. Yet I feel watched.
