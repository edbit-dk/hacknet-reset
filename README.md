# hacknet-reset
"In a world where facts are overwritten and thoughts are monitored, history is no longer written — it is reset." 

RESET is a narrative-driven Hacknet extension inspired by George Orwell’s “1984”. 

You are a mid-level technician in the Ministry of Truth — tasked with resetting history, erasing facts, and upholding the Party’s version of reality. 

But cracks are beginning to show. 

In a world where truth is a matter of control, every line of code and every hidden logfile could be your path to freedom — or your downfall. 

Do you follow protocol? Or do you uncover what was never meant to be seen? 

Big Brother is watching you!
